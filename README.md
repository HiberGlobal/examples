# Hiber API client examples

This folder contains the currently available examples for the Hiber API.

## Mock Server

For easy examples, we've created a mock of the Hiber API.
The code for this server is under mock-server.

You do not need to run it like that, though. It's porvided as a Docker image for easy usage.

To start the mock server, run:

```
docker run -it -p9090:9090 hiberglobal/mock-server:latest
```
